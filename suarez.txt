Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz (American Spanish: [ˈlwis ˈswaɾes]; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Spanish club Atlético Madrid and the Uruguay national team. Known for his passing, finishing and comfort with the ball, he is regarded as one of the best players of his generation, and one of the greatest strikers of all time,[note 1] Suárez has won nineteen major trophies in his career, including seven league titles and a UEFA Champions League at club level, as well as the 2011 Copa América with Uruguay. Suárez has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot, and the Pichichi Trophy. He has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.[11]

Nicknamed El Pistolero ('The Gunman'),[12] Suárez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. There, he won the KNVB Cup. In 2011, Suárez signed for Premier League club Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. In 2014, he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe. That summer, Suárez moved to Barcelona in a transfer worth €82.3 million (£64.98 million), making him one of the most expensive players in football history.[13][14]

In his first season, he won a continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League with Barcelona. In his second season, Suárez won the Pichichi Trophy and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.[15] He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.[16][17] With Barcelona, he won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three Copas del Rey. He signed for Atlético Madrid in 2020, winning his fifth La Liga title on his debut season.[18]

At international level, Suárez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer, and has represented his nation at three editions of the FIFA World Cup and four editions of the Copa América, as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Suárez has been a source of controversy throughout his career.[note 2] As well as his goal-line handball against Ghana at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, he has also bitten opponents on three occasions.[note 3] Suárez has also been accused of and admitted to diving,[26][27] and in 2011, the FA found him guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra.[28]
